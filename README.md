# Faculty-Network-Infrastructure-Project

🌐 Campus Network Design Using Cisco Packet Tracer


Overview:
Led A Team Project To Design And Simulate A Full Campus Network For The Faculty Of Engineering, Using Cisco Packet Tracer. The Goal Was To Build A Scalable, Secure, And Dynamic Network Connecting The Main Faculty Building With The Workshop Building — Ensuring Seamless Communication, Performance, And Centralized Control.


Objectives:
To Build A Network Architecture That Supports Flexibility, Automation, And High Availability — While Maintaining Security And Ease Of Management Across Departments.


🛠️ Key Stages & Techniques:

✅ Survey & Device Mapping

Reviewed All Devices (PCs, Printers, Cameras) Across Floors To Assess Needs And Build A Network Blueprint.

✅ Subnetting

Segmented The Network Into Logical Ranges — Reducing IP Waste, Enhancing Organization, And Strengthening Access Control.

✅ DHCP Configuration

Automated IP Address Assignment To Simplify Setup, Minimize Errors, And Offer Centralized Control.

✅ RIP Protocol Deployment

Enabled Dynamic Routing Between Segments — Allowing Automatic Updates And Quick Adaptation To Network Changes.

✅ SSH & RSA Encryption

Enhanced Security For Remote Management By Encrypting Access And Preventing Unauthorized Connections.

✅ Basic Device Configuration

Set Hostnames, Password Encryption, And Remote Access Protocols For Both Routers And Switches — Ensuring Full Operability.


🎯 Project Outcomes:

✅ Fast, Secure Network Communication

✅ Smooth IP Management & Address Allocation

✅ Automatic Route Updates

✅ High Resilience To Changes

✅ Enhanced Data Protection

✅ Centralized Monitoring & Control

🎓 Project Context:

This Was A Realistic Simulation Project Conducted As Part Of Our Practical Curriculum At The Faculty Of Engineering — With A Strong Focus On Real-World Application, Collaboration, And Technical Execution.


🤝 Teamwork & Leadership:

Proud To Have Led A Dedicated Team Through All Phases — From Planning To Final Simulation — Delivering A Solution That Reflects Best Practices In Modern Network Design.
